### Puzzle Sorting Project

#### Introduction
This project centers around optimizing sorting algorithms to effectively manage sizable datasets within constrained memory environments. Its core functionalities revolve around two pivotal functions: `data_chuncks` and `Puzzle_Function`. These functions are meticulously crafted to tackle the intricate task of sorting data under memory limitations.

#### `data_chuncks(file_path, columns, memory_limitation)`
The `data_chuncks` function loads 2,000 data samples at a time from the specified file_path and sorts them using the merge_sort algorithm. Each sorted chunk of 2,000 data samples is stored as an individual output file under the directory named './Individual/'. The total dataset contains 184,265 data samples, resulting in 93 output files. The last file may have less than 2,000 data samples. Output files follow the naming convention 'sorted_x.csv', where x represents the number of files ranging from 1 to 93.

#### `Puzzle_Function(file_path, memory_limitation, columns)`
The `Puzzle_Function` utilizes the 93 individually sorted files generated by `data_chuncks()` to sort the entire dataset. Similar to `data_chuncks()`, it has a memory limitation of loading and storing 2,000 data samples at most. It may load 2,000 data samples from any of the sorted files. Temporary files can be used to store intermediate sorting results, adhering to the memory limitation. All final sorted output files are stored under the directory named './Final/'. There must be 93 final output files. The data items in the final output files are in ascending order based on the given columns.

#### `chuncks_2000`
`chuncks_2000` is a list data structure used to store 2,000 records at a time from the dataset. It is exclusively used for loading 2,000 records per iteration from the dataset file or the 'Individual' directory, depending on the function being implemented.

#### Usage
1. Import the 'Puzzle_Function.py' module into your Python script or environment.
2. Call the `data_chuncks()` function to generate sorted chunks of data files.
3. Utilize the `Puzzle_Function()` function to sort the entire dataset using the sorted files.
4. Access the sorted output files from the './Final/' directory for further analysis or processing.
